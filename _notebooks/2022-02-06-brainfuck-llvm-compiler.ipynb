    "# Writing a LLVM compiler using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently I have been fascinated by the world of compiled programming languages. My current day to day work mainly involves interpreted languages such as Python and TypeScript. These languages are great for productivity, but they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to performance and resource usage (see [benchmarks](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html)). In order to learn more about compiled languages I started writing small programs in C++, go and Rust. Rust is awesome! In 13 lines of code a rust noob can managed to write a function that looks for a string (in lowercase and uppercase) inside of a SHA256 hash. The kicker, it is fully **parallel** thanks to the rayon library! This is usually not that easy to do in other system languages. The only difference between the single threaded and parallel code is `.into_par_iter()` part.\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "pub fn find_hash(name: &str) -> String {\n",
    "    let name_upper = &name.to_uppercase();\n",
    "    let result = (0u64..u64::MAX).into_par_iter().find_any(|&i| {\n",
    "        let mut hasher = Sha256::new();\n",
    "        hasher.update(i.to_string().as_bytes());\n",
    "        let hash = base64::encode(&hasher.finalize());\n",
    "        return hash.contains(name) || hash.contains(name_upper);\n",
    "    });\n",
    "    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();\n",
    "    hasher.update(result.unwrap().to_string().as_bytes());\n",
    "    let hash = base64::encode(&hasher.finalize());\n",
    "    hash\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is something that Rust has in common with that this post is about, it compiles down to [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) intermediate representation (IR). LLVM is basically a set of tools for developers to make compilers. A developer just needs to get their code into IR. After that, LLVM can optimize the IR for various metrics and then either run it in a jitted execution engine or compile it to machine code. One other nice thing about IR is that it is \"portable\" (we'll come to why I wrapped portable in quotes). There is no need to rewrite your compiler for every system architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brainfuck\n",
    "In order to learn LLVM I decided to implement a compiler for one of the simplest programming languages: [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)(BF). It is a tape based language that only has these operators: `+` `-` `<` `>` `[` `]` `.` `,`. When a BF program starts an array of 8 bit integers is initialized with zeros, this is the tape. There is also a pointer that we'll call `tape_ptr` that points to the \"current\" element in the array. A program might look something like this: `+++.`. This means increment the integer at the `tape_ptr` by one three times, then write the integer at the `tape_ptr` to the standard output (in our case the console). One would think that a three would be printed, but the console interprets the integer as a char type. A char of value “3” does not display. If we wanted a three to print we would have to write `-[----->+<]>.`. This program decrements the current element (which overflows into 255). Then it enters a sort of while-loop given by `[]`. The code between the brackets is looped \"while the current element is not zero\". The `>` and `<` shift the position of the `tape_ptr` either to the right or left. The program therefore does the following:\n",
    "- `-` decrement the current position\n",
    "- `[----->+<]`\n",
    "  - `-----` decrement the current element 5 times\n",
    "  - `>` move one step to the right\n",
    "  - `+` increment the current element\n",
    "  - `<` move on step to the left (the initial position)\n",
    "  - `]` is the value at the current element zero? \n",
    "    - if TRUE continue to the next operation (to the right)\n",
    "    - if FALSE go back to the previous `[`\n",
    "- `.` write the current value to stdout\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that the element in the second position is incremented once for every time the element in the first position is decremented five times. This gives `255/5=51`, where `255` is the overflown integer and `51` is the ascii character `'3'`. We will ignore the `,` instruction as it is quite useless; I have personally never used it. It is used for reading from stdin. However, if one is interested in writing programs in BF one should implement it in order to be able to use the language fully!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Now to the compiler\n",
    "In unrelated project have used a python library called [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) a lot to speed up numerical computations. It manages to be so fast by compiling a subset of python down to IR which is then run on LLVM's jit execution engine. It can easily speed up python by [24 times](https://github.com/ridulfo/Sudoku-solver-implementations) and come close to C++ speeds. Numba uses a library called [llvmlite](https://github.com/numba/llvmlite) to generate the IR. This is the library we are going to be using. \n",
    "\n",
    "This whole project has really been a brainfuck. The documentation has been much thinner than I am used and, in some cases, nonexistent. To learn how to make [system calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) to the operating system kernel in order to write to stdout I had to read what registers to populate with what values by looking at source code. Because we are doing this on... Darwin ARM64! Which wants to have values in other registers than the linux on ARM64, or so it seems depending on what documentation you read. At this level, the error messages stop being helpful. When trying to implement the syscalls the kernel would just say things like:\n",

Think of it as calling on the operating system’s API that does things like write or read to stdout or files, open sockets, mount and unmount drives, change the permissions of files and much much more. The problem is that LLVM has nothing to do with the kernel. This is usually handled by local libraries. We therefore must implement this by writing native assembly. This is the part where the program becomes system architecture specific. I think that this is where we would normally be linking to local libraries that would handle this for us.\n",

This might be the best [table](https://thog.github.io/syscalls-table-aarch64/latest.html) I have found. However, it does not fully work on my machine.

    "fty = ir.FunctionType(ir.IntType(32), [\n",
    "    ir.IntType(32),  # x16 (=4)\n",
    "    ir.IntType(32),  # x0 (=1)\n",
    "    ir.IntType(8).as_pointer(), # x1\n",
    "    ir.IntType(32)   # x2\n",
    "])\n",
    "builder.asm(fty, \"svc 0\", \"=r,{x16},{x0},{x1},{x2}\", (\n",

    "First, we create a function type, it is basically a call signature. The assembly will return a 32-bit integer and take the following inputs. The \"inputs\" are values that we are going to put in the registers `{x16},{x0},{x1},{x2}`.\n",
    "1. 32-bit integer - The type of syscall (write call)\n",
    "1. 32-bit integer - Where to write (stdout)\n",
    "1. 8-bit integer - Pointer to the char array (in our case only the current element)\n",
    "1. 32-bit integer - The length of the char array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the llvmlite library has a convenient way to write out values to the registers automatically without us having to move every value into the registers. We just specify the \"constraint\" ` \"=r,{x16},{x0},{x1},{x2}\"` and then pass the values in the args parameter \n",

    "The actual assembly is the `svc 0` instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also implemented an exit instruction to BF that can be used by writing `e`. It makes an exit syscall.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "builder.asm(ir.FunctionType(ir.IntType(32),\n",
    "    [ir.IntType(32), ir.IntType(32)]),\n",
    "    \"svc 0\", \"=r,{x0},{x16}\",\n",
